## :sparkles: Game Design and Mechanics
_A Deep Dive into Procedural Generation, Physics-Based Gameplay, Player Choice and Branching Narratives, Resource Management and Economy Systems, and Social Mechanics and Multiplayer Interactions_
### Procedural Generation
Procedural generation simply means to generate data or any contect based on some procedures, rules, algorithm, logics whatever you call it. 

Remember getting 500 times “I am sorry!” kinda handwritten punishments? It was indeed really hectic. But on computer you can do the task by using a signle loop in no time. It’s just giving **instructions** and **conditions**.

In Games development making hundreds and thousands of levels by hand is an utter incovinience both in terms of time and money also fixed level designs can become boring by time and provides a poor user experience. However a system of procedural generation offers **infinite replayability**. With procedural design, players are always presented with new challenges, pushing them to learn more about the game. Additionally, procedural content can be adaptive and adjust to the player's style and the level of difficulty required to make the player stay engaged in the game for a long run.

However, there are :anger: downsides to procedural design. 

_One size never actually fits all_, and procedural content is rarely as powerful as handcrafted content. Sacrifice the exact experience you want to give to the players. Procedural design is also expensive, requiring a lot of time and resources to make. Also procedural content cannot always be coherent, engaging, or not broken, as it is **quasi-random**, following a set of rules about how the randomness works, such as how big rooms should be, how many resources, exits, and so on. 

Therefore, it is essential to use procedural generation effectively and to balance it with handcrafted content to provide the best possible user experience.

#### :pushpin: Examples

Games like **Roblox** offers tools and features that allow the creators to procedurally generate events and game content (Although it is not solely focused on procedural generation).

Some other games like **GTA, Temple Run, subway surfers** etc comes in category of games based on procedural generation.

### Physics based Games
The physics based games are ones who... well simple! utilizes **physics** concepts in games. How the gravity is going to effect the player or an NPC of different mass and sizes, maximum jump height, air resistence, speed of shooting bullet and many more.

The best thing about physics based games are that they add an immersive experience to the game. The player get to understand how physics is effecting the player, how the player is going to tackle all the challenges with the provided skills. The player has to make continuous strategies to survive. All of this provides great experience and great curosity to excel further and more.

There are some :anger: downsides to it as well.

In order to incorporate physics engine it requires a powerful hardware for game to run smoothly. Also there are limited physics mechanics available in the engines, creating physics mechanics from scratch is certainly challenging, specially for indie game developers. Sometimes it is difficult to learn the physics behaviours in a game at start, which might lead to frustration and uncertainty.

#### :pushpin: Examples

Some of the coolest examples of physics based games are **FallGuys, AngryBird, BounceTales 2D etc**
